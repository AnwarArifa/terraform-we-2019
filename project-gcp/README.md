# Project Creation Factory

Use this project for creating projects in GCP. The earlier repo https://tools.lowes.com/stash/projects/E-DPIAC/repos/terraform-platform-org/browse should not be used anymore.
 - The earlier repo worked with older versions of terraform hence has been replaced.
 - It did not support enabling apis via terrafrom, this allows us to do so.

## Regarding Folder Creation

If you are creating folders you need to do multiple master merges because of the folder ID generated by GCP.
 - Add code for parent folder first, say GCP > digital > assetmgmt
 - Perform merge and deploy
 - Grab the parent folder ID either from output or https://console.cloud.google.com
 - Create your child folder, say GCP > digital > assetmgmt > assetmgmt-npe
 - Add the parent folder_id to your folder/variables.tfvars
 - Perform merge and deploy
 - Grab the child folder ID either from output or https://console.cloud.google.com
 - Add the child folder_id to your project/variables.tfvars
 - Proceed creating you new project(s)
